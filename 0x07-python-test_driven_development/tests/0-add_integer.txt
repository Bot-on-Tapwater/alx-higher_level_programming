 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``add_integer()``.

Numbers
=======

``add_integer()`` returns the sum of its arguments. For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``+`` operator.

::

    >>> add_integer = __import__('0-add_integer').add_integer 
    >>> add_integer(2, 3)
    5

It also works with floating-point values.

::

    >>> add_integer(2.0, 3)
    5

Non-Numbers
===========

Because ``+`` is also defined on data types other than numbers,
``add_integer()`` works just as well if one of the arguments is a
string, a list, or a tuple.

::

    >>> add_integer('a', 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: a must be an integer

    >>> add_integer(['A', 'B', 'C'], 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: a must be an integer
